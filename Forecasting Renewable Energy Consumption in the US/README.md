## Forecasting Renewable Energy Consumption in the US
Analyzed trends in renewable energy consumption in the US over time from 1973 to 2024, and across various sectors. Then, we tried to implement the Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average model (SARIMA) for future consumption prediction. 

## Dataset
The data was sourced from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

## Tools Used
Python

## Key Insights
- The most significant energy-consuming sectors are industrial, electric power, and transportation.
- The predominant sources of energy are biomass energy and conventional hydroelectric power, which have been consistently consumed over the years.
- Biomass energy has seen a particularly significant increase compared to the other source. Other renewable energy sources, such as biodiesel, renewable diesel fuel, wind energy and solar energy were moderately consumed in the past but have experienced substantial growth since 2000. This shift is promising for economic, environmental, and health-related reasons.
- SARIMA model is performing extremely well — with near-perfect accuracy (MAPE 0.2%). It’s a very solid model.
