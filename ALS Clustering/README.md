## Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
Used Machine learning to classify patients as either affected by ALS or not based on multiple clinical and physiological features. That certainly may support early detection and improve understanding of the disease. 

## Tools used
Python

## Key insights 
The clustering algorithm has found meaningful groupings in the data. However, a slight overlapping exists indicating that the the two clusters have few similar features.
Additionally, data points far from main clusters which presents outliers might represent unusual cases of ALS, such as patients with rare genetic mutations, atypical symptoms, or distinct disease progressions. these rare unusual cases of ALS that could warrant further investigation.
