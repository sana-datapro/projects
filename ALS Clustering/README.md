## Problem
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a complex and heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease that affects patients differently in terms of symptoms, progression rate, and response to treatment. This variability makes it difficult for clinicians and researchers to design effective, personalized treatment plans or to predict disease progression accurately.

## Method
Clustering ALS patients with similar clinical features, genetic markers, or progression patterns. By identifying these hidden subgroups, researchers and healthcare providers can gain deeper insights into disease mechanisms and tailor interventions to specific patient profiles.

## Tools used
Python

## Key insights 
The clustering algorithm has found meaningful groupings in the data. However, a slight overlapping exists indicating that the the two clusters have few similar features.
Additionally, data points far from main clusters which presents outliers might represent unusual cases of ALS, such as patients with rare genetic mutations, atypical symptoms, or distinct disease progressions. these rare unusual cases of ALS that could warrant further investigation.
