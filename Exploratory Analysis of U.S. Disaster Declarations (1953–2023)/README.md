## Objective:
A comprehensive analysis of FEMA disaster declarations in the US to identify yearly trends, seasonal patterns, assess state-level disaster activity and the FEMA assistance programs utilization to provide data-driven insights that can support improved disaster preparedness, more effective resource allocation, and enhanced mitigation planning in high risk regions. 

## Dataset
The dataset summarizes FEMA disaster declarations from 1953 to 2023. It is sourced from the FEMA website (https://www.fema.gov/openfema-data-page/disaster-declarations-summaries-v2) and exists in the public Kaggle platform (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/headsortails/us-natural-disaster-declarations).

## Tools
Python

## Key Findings 
- A long-term increase in disaster declarations from 1953 to 2023. Major spikes around 2005, in 2012 and in 2020.
- Disasters activity peaks in March and September, while the quietest months are November and December. The remaining months — January, February, April, May, June, July, August, and October — show moderate levels of disaster declarations.
- Texas is the most disaster-impacted state in the dataset. Other states with high program activity. Central and northern states show moderate FEMA activity. Western states and Small-population and island jurisdictions show lower declaration counts.
- Disaster types diverse across the U.S. Severe storms, hurricanes, and floods are the most frequent hazards. Then come the wildfires, Tornadoes, snowstorms, freezing events with moderate declaration levels. Rarer declarations include coastal storms, earthquakes, drought, volcanic eruptions, and typhoons.
- High demand for Public Assistance (PA) and hazard mitigation efforts. 

## Recommendations
To strengthen disaster response and preparedness:

1. Prioritize additional funding and resources for high-risk states
2. Optimize Public Assistance (PA) delivery
3. Strengthen Hazard Mitigation (HM) investments in the most vulnerable hazard zones
4. Prepare targeted seasonal readiness plans
5. Improve state-level coordination, especially where federal declarations are lower
6. Review and enhance assistance for rural, small-population, and island territories
7. Establish a long-term strategy for recurring hazards
