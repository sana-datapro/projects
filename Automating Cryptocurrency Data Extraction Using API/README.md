## Problem
Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, and prices, trading volumes, and market trends change every second across hundreds of coins and exchanges. Manually collecting or updating this data from websites is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient.

An automated coin market data extraction system using an API solves this problem by continuously fetching real-time and historical cryptocurrency data — such as prices, market capitalization, and trading volume — directly from reliable sources like CoinMarketCap. This automation ensures accuracy, speed, and scalability for analysis or modeling.

# Method
built a programm that automates the process of extracting the data from the website https://coinmarketcap.com/ using API.

## Tools Used
Python (libraries used such as requests, time, json and pandas)
