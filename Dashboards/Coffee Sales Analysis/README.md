## Key Insights
This interactive Excel dashboard visualizes monthly coffee sales trends from 2019 to 2022 across three countries — the USA, the UK, and Ireland. The analysis covers four coffee types: Arabica, Excelsa, Liberica, and Robusta.

The United States recorded the highest total sales, reaching approximately $35,700, with peak performance observed in 2021, outperforming both Ireland and the UK. This insight suggests potential for expanding coffee affiliates in the U.S. to further enhance profitability.

Arabica emerged as the most popular coffee type, followed by Excelsa and Liberica, while Robusta showed the lowest sales volume. In 2022, notable sales peaks occurred in January, March, and June, indicating key periods for optimized resource allocation and marketing efforts.

Additionally, customers without loyalty cards generated approximately $19,000 in sales, compared to $16,500 from loyalty card holders. Strengthening customer engagement strategies — such as offering exclusive discounts or incentives for loyalty members — could help drive higher sales from this segment.

Overall, the dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of sales distribution by time period, country, coffee type, and customer segment, enabling data-driven decisions to identify key markets and improve product performance.
