## Problem
The company lacked clear visibility into its sales and profits in 2019 compared to previous years. Without a centralized system to track and analyze sales data across customers, channels, and regions, management could not identify where or why performance could drop or increase. This project was developed to analyse sales trends through channels and regions, and provide actionable insights to support data-driven decision-making

## Key Insights

- Overall Performance:
Total product sales in 2017 and 2018 were notably higher compared to 2019, with an overall 10% decline in sales. Consequently, profit decreased by approximately 8%, dropping from $19.8 million in 2018 to $18.3 million in 2019. This decline in profitability appears directly linked to the reduction in sales volume.

Possible contributing factors include lower order volumes from key consumers and reduced demand among regional distributors. For instance, the company’s top customer, Medline, reduced its purchases from $0.8 million in 2018 to $0.6 million in 2019, significantly impacting total revenue.

- Channel Performance:
In 2019, profitability across the wholesale and distribution channels declined, while the export channel showed a 10% increase in profit. This suggests a strategic shift in profitability sources, indicating that international or online market sales have become more lucrative compared to traditional domestic distribution.

- Regional Insights:
The top-performing cities by sales include Waitomo, Auckland, Rodney, Southland, and Christchurch. However, both Auckland and Southland experienced a notable decrease in sales during 2019, which may indicate localized demand challenges or increased competition in those regions.

- Seasonal Trends:
Comparing 2019 sales to the previous year (PY) over time reveals a sharp decline in sales between October and December. This period typically aligns with the peak sales season, suggesting potential issues such as inventory shortages, market saturation, or weakened promotional strategies during the final quarter of 2019.
