## Problem
Manually analysing thousands of movie reviews to understand the audience sentiment is time-consuming and not efficient. A statistical sentiment analysis technique will helps automatically to categorize movie reviews as positive, negative or neutral.

## Method
Classified movie reviews based on user sentiment using two popular natural language processing tools: VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) and TextBlob. Both are rule-based sentiment analyzers designed to interpret the polarity of text data. 

## Tools Used
Python

## Key Insights
The Vader sentiment analyser is performing slightly better than the TexBlob sentiment analyser. This will help studios and platforms to measure the public opinion about a movie and so understand if it was well-receved or not.
