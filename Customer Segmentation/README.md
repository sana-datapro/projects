## Problem
Businesses often deal with a large and diverse customer base where each customer has different preferences, behaviors, and purchasing patterns. Treating all customers the same way — with identical marketing strategies, product offers, or pricing — leads to inefficient marketing and lost opportunities.
Grouping customers into distinct segments based on shared characteristics such as demographics, purchasing history, or spending habits helps businesses understand their customers better and make data-driven decisions.

## Method
-Applied the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment a retail company's customers into meaningful and actionable groups. 
-Developed targeted recommendations to help stakeholders take informative decisions.

## Dataset
The data was sourced from the open data platform Kaggle (www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis).

## Tools Used
PowerPoint, Python

## Key Insights
- The K-Means clustering algorithm helped to segment the customers into four clusters based on their spending patterns and their demographic attributes:
      -  Young non parents with moderate spending
      -  Adult non-parents with low spending 
      -  Adult non-parents with high spending
      -  Adult parents with very low spending
      -  Adult parents with moderate-to-high spending
      
   - These results empower Stakeholders to tailor their marketing campaigns and personalize engagement strategies for each customer group, improving overall business performance and customer satisfaction.
