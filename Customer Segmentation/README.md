## Customers Segmentation using K-Means Algorithm
This project provides an opportunity to showcase my ability to apply the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment a retail company's customers into meaningful and actionable groups. Based on the clustering results, I developed targeted recommendations to help stakeholders take informative decisions.

## Dataset
The data was sourced from the open data platform Kaggle (www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis).

## Tools Used
PowerPoint, Python

## Key Insights
- The K-Means clustering algorithm helped to  segment the customers into four clusters based on their spending patterns and their demographic attributes:
      -  Young non parents with moderate spending
      -  Adult non-parents with low spending 
      -  Adult non-parents with high spending
      -  Adult parents with very low spending
      -  Adult parents with moderate-to-high spending
      
   - These results empower Stakeholders to tailor their marketing campaigns and personalize engagement strategies for each customer group, improving overall business performance and customer satisfaction.
