# Predicting Student Potential Math Misconceptions
Developed an NLP model to predict students'potential math misconceptions based on their explanations of open ended responses using the DeBERTa v3 base model which efficiently captures word meaning and position with strong performance. This will help teachers to easily identify and address students'incorrect thinking and certainly improve their math learning.
Short summary of what the project does.

## Dataset
The data is sourced from public platform Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/map-charting-student-math-misunderstandings/data).

## Tools Used
Python (pandas, sklearn, transformers, datasets libraries used)

## Key Insights
I successfully preprocessed the dataset and implemented the DeBERTa v3-base model, which achieved a 97% accuracy in predicting potential misconceptions in studentsâ€™ math explanations.
