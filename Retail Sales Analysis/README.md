## Data Visualisation: Empowering Business with Effective Insights (Virtual Internship)

## Objective of the analysis
I am going to walk you through insights from transactional retail data to answer CEO & CMO questions about revenue trends, top revenue generating countries and customers, and geographic demand to support forecasting, customer targeting and international expansion decisions.

## Insights and Recommendations
- Revenue is relatively stable through most of the year, but accelarates sharply from August to November. This suggests aligning marketing, inventory and operational planning ahead of this period to fully capture the peak demand and avoid missed revenue opportunities.
- The UK remains the core revenue driver and must be defended. At the same time, non-UK revenue currently represents only a small share, creating an opportunity  and a necessity to diversify revenue geographically.
- Netherlands and Ireland are the strongest non-UK markets and should be prioritized for immediate marketing and growth investment.
- Germany and France form the strongest second tier showing stable demand and offering reliable opportunities for expansion.
- Australia stands out as the strongest non-UK market validating further international scaling.
- Markets such as Spain, Switzerland, Belgium, Sweden, and Norway currently contribute modestly to the revenue. I recommend targeted pilot initiatives rather than broad investment and scaling only when demand proves sustainable.
- While no single customer dominates revenue, the top customers collectively contribute a critical meaningful share. So, I suggest efficient retention strategies targeting those high-value customers.
- The revenue is strongly driven by sales volume. So, we should focus on strategies that increase order frequency and quantity, supported by strong availability and logistics to greatly impact the overall revenue.
