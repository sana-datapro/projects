## Overview:

### A-REGRESSION

### Predicting Houses Prices

In real estate, fair and consistent pricing is crucial for buyers, sellers, banks, and policymakers. Using multiple features ensures that valuations are data-driven rather than subjective and accurate predictions help homeowners decide when to sell, buyers understand affordability, banks assess mortgage risks, and investors evaluate opportunities.


### A-CLASSIFICATION

### Customers Segmentation

This project provides an opportunity to showcase my ability to apply the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment a retail company's customers into meaningful and actionable groups. Based on the clustering results, I developed targeted recommendations to help stakeholders optimize their marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.

### Movie reviews Sentiment Analysis

In this project, I utilized the TextBlob and Vader sentiment analysers to perform sentiment classification on movie reviews and evaluated their performance in comparison to random guessing.

### Spam Emails Detection

Receiving spams whether through emails, messages or modern channels is a huge challenge for individuals and organizations. This project was an opportunity for me to implement the random forest classifier to effectively classify emails into spams or not spams. 

### Map Charting Student Math Misunderstandings

In this project, I developed an NLP model (the DeBERTa v3 base model) to predict students'potential math misconceptions based on their explanations of open-ended responses. This will help teachers to identify easily and address students'incorrect thinking and certainly improve their math learning.


### B- TIME SERIES ANALYSIS

### Predicting Renewable energy consumption

The use of renewable energy has increased over the years, driven by factors such as political policies, environmental concerns, public health considerations, and economic incentives.
In this project, I analyzed renewable energy consumption patterns and developed forecasts for future usage using SARIMA model.


### C- Movies Recommender System

Developing a program that recommends the top 10 highest-rated movies is essential for enhancing user experience and driving greater profitability for companies.


### D- APPLICATION

### Weather Forecasting Application

This project was an opportunity for me to create an application that predicts the weather condition with just using zip code or city, using the free open weather map platform.

### E- WEB SCRIPTING: 

### Automating Cryptocurrency Market Data Retrieval via API

In this project, I implemented an automated process to extract cryptocurrency market data using an API.

### F- Data Cleaning and Exploration in SQL

In this project I used MySQL to clean and explore global employees layoffs from COVID-19 to 2025.

### G- Dashboards

I included here three dashboards created using Power BI.
